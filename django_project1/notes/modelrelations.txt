    for eg: menuCategory under menuitem, students under classroom , participants under same chatroom
    commands:
    Student.objects.create(name="",age="",classroom=<obj>)
    Student.objects.filter(id=1).update(classroom_id=2)

    student= Student.objects.get(id=1)
    student.classroom_id=3
    student.save()
    student.clasroom.name

    #for relative name
    classroom=ClassRoom.objects.get(id=1)
    students= classroom.classroom_students.all()
